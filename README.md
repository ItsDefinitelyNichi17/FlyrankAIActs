# CRUD EXPRESS
A to-do list that manage data using Postgres + Docker. It involves the creation, deletion, filtering, update and getting the task status/statistics. Check endpoint `/docs` to read all the request of this API using `swagger-ui-express`.

## Note to the Evaluator
I compile all of my tasks in this repository, you can check each history through its designated branches named after
the task week, act number, and my current course : `W1A1BE`.

## How to run
* install dependencies using : `npm install`
* run using : `npm run dev`
* to insert mock data on table : `npm run seed`
* run the container with postgresql18+ image: `docker run --name taskdb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here -e POSTGRES_DB=tasks -p 5432:5432 -v taskdata:/var/lib/postgresql -d postgres`

## SQLite
### Why SQLite
SQLite is used for this project because of its persistency. Single file, zero setup, and survive server restarts.

### Test it
To test the database using SQLite, you can run these command on your respective engine viewer.
* `SELECT * FROM tasks;` : This displays the table consist of all tasks
* `DROP TABLE tasks;` : This drops the table named tasks, you can create a table using `npm run seed` which also creates mock data. You can also check the [schema.sql](src/schema/task.schema.sql) to create a table
* `DELETE FROM tasks;`: Delete all record inside the table
<br>
<br>
if you are running this on sqlite3, you can connect to the task.db by running this inside the project:
<br>

```
sqlite3 task.db
.open task.db`
```

<br>
Then run the commands above to try the database!

### Sample
Sample Table from with the use of sqlite3 CLI 
<br>

`SELECT * FROM this tasks;`
